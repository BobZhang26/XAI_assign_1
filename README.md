## XAI Assignment 1: Explain Explainable AI
Find a recent paper on Explainable AI and explain it to the rest of the class. This paper can be on any topic related to Explainable AI (Interpretable ML, AI alignment, Explainable AI methods, adversarial attacks/defenses, red-teaming, etc). 

You decide the format of your explanation. This could be a video presentation or code demonstration. It could be something creative: a painting, a song/rap, a dance, a poem (slam poem?), a childrenâ€™s book, etc. If putting together a video, it should be <5 minutes in length (unless there is a creative component that requires more length-if so, discuss with me).
